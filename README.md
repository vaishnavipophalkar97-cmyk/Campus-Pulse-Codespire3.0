# Campus-Pulse-Codespire3.0
CampusPulse is a smart campus engagement platform that centralizes campus events, announcements, and information, making it easier for students to stay informed and connected. It also integrates an AI-Powered QueryBot using Google Gemini to answer campus-related queries intelligently.
## Problem-Statement 
Campus-related information such as events, workshops, and announcements is scattered across notice boards, whatsapp groups, and multiple websites. This leads to missed updates, confusion, and lack of engagement among students. There is need for a single, unified, and intelligent platform to access all campus information efficiently.
## Solution-Overview 
CampusPulse acts like a "District App for Campus", providing :
   - A Centralized platform for all campus events and updates.
   - Categorized event listings for better discoverability.
   - An AI-Powered QueryBot that allows students to ask campus-related questions and get instant responses.
The platform focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and scalability.
## Key-Features
   - 📆 Centralized campus event listing.
   - 🗃️ Category-based event filtering.
   - 🌐 Responsive UI
   - 🚀 Scalable architecture for future enhancements.
## Google Technologies Used 
Google Gemini API is used to power the AI QueryBot. It enables intelligent, context-aware responses to user queries and demonstrates AI integration as required by the hackathon. The backend communicates securely with the Gemini API to process campus-related queries and generate intelligent responses. Due to deployment and and environment limitations, the Gemini powered responses may not be fully visible . However, the complete backend integration logic is implemented and available in the repository,demonstrating the intended AI functionality and scalability of the solution.
